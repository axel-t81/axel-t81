- 👋 Hello, I’m @axel-t81
-  🌱 As of March 2024 I've been transitioning careers from accounting & bookkeeping to becoming a developer or software engineer. I'm making use of the vast amount of learning materials online, while also studying a **_Masters of IT at the University of New England (UNE)_**, and completing certificate courses on Coursera.
- 👀 My current interests include **_Python, Django web apps, SQL and PostgreSQL_**, as well as more long term goals in AI, machine learning, and computer vision, as well as algorithmic trading and different fintech apps.
- 🔥 I'd like to be eventually become a tech founder, but at this point just want more experience and training within a team that I can learn with and from. **_I'm keen to work with startups, or innovative and entrepreneurial organisations, or just teams that offer solid training and development._**
- 💞️ In 2024 I joined both the **_IEEE_** and the **_Australian Computer Society (ACS)_**, and have really loved being part of these professional associations. I hope to develop my ties to these organisations more over time, and continue to learn from the experts that both the IEEE and ACS regularly allow me exposure to.
