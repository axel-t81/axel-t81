- 👋 Hi there, I’m @axel-t81
-  🌱 As of March 2024 I've been transitioning careers from accounting & bookkeeping to becoming a developer or software engineer. Hope to make use of all the learning materials online, while also studying a Gradute Diploma of IT at the University of New England (UNE), and completing certificate courses on Coursera.
- 👀 Current interests include Python, the Django framework, SQL and PostgreSQL, Rest APIs, Solidity (or Vyper!) & Ethereum, and vanilla front ends with HTML and CSS.
- 🔥 I'd like to be a tech founder, but could probably use more experience and training as a junior in a team first. Keen to work with startups, or innovative and entrepreneurial organisations, or just teams that offer solid training and development.
- 💞️ I'm open to a wide variety of colloborations, and would really just be happy collaborting with almost anyone on anything to build my experience, confidence and network.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via the contact points provided on my GitHub Profile :-D
