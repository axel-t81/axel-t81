- 👋 Hi, I’m @axel-t81
- 👀 I’m interested in Ethereum and Web3, general Web Development, and working with startups and other small, nimble, innovative organisations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to change careers from accounting and bookkeeping to become a developer or software engineer. Hope to make use of all the free learning materials online, and will also be studying a Gradute Diploma of IT at the University of New England (UNE).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things; currently I'm a single palm swaying in the desert winds. So, I'd really just be happy collaborting with almost anyone on anything and building my experience, confidence and network.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via the contact points provided on my GitHub Profile, and let me know you found me through this GitHub Profile :-D
