- 👋 Hi, I’m @axel-t81
- 👀 I’m interested in Ethereum and Web3, general Web Development, and working with startups and other small, nimble, innovative organisations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to change careers from accounting and bookkeeping to become a developer or software engineer. Hope to be studying a UNE GradDip in IT in the coming weeks as well as making the most of all the free learning materials online.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things; currently I'm a single palm swaying in the desert winds. So, I'd really just be happy collaborting with almost anyone on anything and building my experience, confidence and network.
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out here on GitHub, and can swap details from there. Most of my social presence is still tied to my legacy business, so I haven't yet got appropriate social contact details yet.
